Swerve Notes



Elevator Notes

20:1 gear ratio 
2 motors
1 encoder (2 in code)
logic for soft stops:
    Elevator can't go down when wrist is in the way;  see wrist soft stop 1
    can't go too far down or up
    no go up when no coral




Wrist Notes

1 motor
1 encoder probably
logic for soft stops:
    when the Elevator is down the wrist can't go back;  carter said to move the arm instead of just stopping it
    can't go a full rotation, can't go too far back or forward
    




Intake Notes

1 or 2 motors?
motor(s) spin(s) wheels
need a sensor to see coral (maybe algae too)
no foreseeable soft stops
don't need position/angle only velocity





Danger Zone Notes

1:










Other Notes
10 in.  to bottom of wrist from pivot
16.5 in. to top of wrist from pivot
